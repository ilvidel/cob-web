## A bit of History

The City of Bristol Volleyball Club is a Bristol based volleyball club
that caters to all skill levels. Our club currently consists of four
men's teams and two women's teams that compete in the Southwest,
Gloucestershire and National Leagues. We are also affiliated with the
University of Bristol through its Open Sports Club Program.

The formation of the club occurred as a result of a merger between two
of Bristol's oldest volleyball clubs, Whitefield and Speedwell. The
merger, which took place in the summer of 2004, was driven by goals
shared by both clubs:

- improve the profile of volleyball as a sport in the UK
- increase volleyball participation in Bristol and surrounding areas
- create an environment to produce skilled athletes and winning teams

As a start, the merger is intended to allow people of all skill levels
to play within one club. A vision for the next couple of years sees up
to eight teams: four men's and four women's, competing in the various
Southwest, Gloucestershire and National Leagues.

Our vision for participation also targets players from the University
of Bristol clubs. It is hoped that providing students with an
opportunity to play outside of the University will attract a more
skilled and consistent player base for the University
squads. Currently, the most talented players on University teams are
students from the continent who only stay for one year. This, combined
with the fact that EVA and BUSA student competitions take place over
the course of a single weekend, mean that these squads don't have the
opportunity to develop a good program. The formation of the City of
Bristol Volleyball Club, with the University as a key member, is
intended to remedy this situation.

More information for students can be found in our students section.
